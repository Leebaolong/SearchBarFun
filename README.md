iOS 7 Searchbar transition expirement
============

With iOS 7 came some great features as well as some weird behavior with regards to search bars.

This little example was an experiment to see if it was possible to animate a UISearchBar into the navigation bar without actually having the UISearchBar visible on the view.

From what I have observed if you want to animate a UISearchBar into the navigation bar it iOS 7 assumes it will be displayed / visible somewhere in your view.

This example shows you that it is possible to animate a search bar into a navigation bar without it being visible.
